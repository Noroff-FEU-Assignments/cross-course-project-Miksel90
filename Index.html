    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are numerous ways to secure your website from web security attacks and it is essential that everyone working on the website are involed with security. All security should be proactive and not reactive. All team members must be educated in potential security hazards and must understand how the website can be vulnerable. Security issues should be treated like any other issue. The team should adapt some best-practices to help with security. I would advise a cybersecurity framework. start researching potential risks and construct a response plan for when your web security is threatened. Ensure that the authorization and authentication are difficult to get around either by doing it manually or by using an authorization framework like OneLogin. I would also recommend automating and integrating security tools, and to use diverse security measures. All data should be sanitized to ensure that the data is in the right format. This can be done manually or by using a third-party application. If you use a third-party make sure its a well-known third-party application, and do some research on the application beforehand. Check forums, feedback and number of downloads it has the last couple of weeks.I would advise the client to invest in a vulnerability scanner to help with oversights from the developers. Make sure that the developers know what networks to log on and to use secure networks when sharing data.the team should practice working on different attacks to reveal potential risks.
