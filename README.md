I had to make som changes from my prototype. For accessibilty i had to change some colors on most of my text since the white color did not hav eneough contrast to the brown. I also did not have time to put in all the icons for SOME, or add to favourites buttons. I also changed the nav a bit since i i could get it to look exactly the same. I also changed the layout of my register and checkout pages, as i couldnt get them to look like nice across all screens. Overall im quite happy with the result as I thought i would not make the deadline. I know some of my images are above 200kb but that was one of the last criterias I checked and I did not have time to find other fitting images, so i would definatly change that if I had time to searh for the "right" images. i feel like like this task was quite huge and complex for my first project, and it was a lot to wrap my head around so im just hoping im gonna pass. I realy have to thank MJphillip who helped me alot along the way and was relay quick with the feedback. I tried to clean up the html as much as i could, but there was something left, that i didnt understand, like the line i had in my list. It also told med it was a loose /div but when i tried to remove it it destoryed my page. in the wave part I dont have labels for the search bar nor the color buttons. not sure how to label the color buttons, but i would look into that when adding Js.
